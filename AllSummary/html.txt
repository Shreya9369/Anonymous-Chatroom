### 1. **HTML Structure Overview**

* **Root Element**: The document begins with `<!DOCTYPE html>` indicating that it's an HTML5 document. The `<html lang="en">` tag defines the document language as English.
* **Head Section**:

  * Meta tags define the character set (`UTF-8`) and viewport settings for responsive design (`width=device-width, initial-scale=1`).
  * The page title is "Anonymous Chatroom," which will appear in the browser tab.
  * A link to an external stylesheet (`style.css`) for styling the page.

### 2. **Body Section**

The body contains the main content of the chat application, including modals, header, chat area, and footer.

#### **Modals**

* **Nickname Modal (`#nickname-modal`)**:

  * This modal asks users to choose a nickname when they join the chat. It is hidden by default with `aria-hidden="true"`.
  * Contains an input field for the nickname (`#nickname-input`) and a submit button to join the chat.
* **Chat Rules Modal (`#rules-modal`)**:

  * This modal shows the rules for the chatroom (e.g., be respectful, no spam). It is also hidden initially.
  * Contains a close button to exit the modal.

#### **Header Section (`<header class="chat-header">`)**
